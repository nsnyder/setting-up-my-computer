# Getting Started

There are some things that should be done before anything else
when you start up your Mac.

## Brew
The first thing to install on Mac OS is install [Brew](https://brew.sh).
The instructions should be available on the website. Most other things on
Mac will be installed through Brew.

## Fonts

### Fira Code

This is my preferred font for programming. To install it, follow the instructions
[here](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/wiki/Installing).

### Menlo for Powerline

Menlo for Powerline is necessary to get all the desired affects when running
[Powerline](Programming.md#powerline) in the terminal. Get it [here](https://github.com/abertsch/Menlo-for-Powerline).

## Karabiner Elements

Install Karabiner-Elements with:

`brew cask install karabiner-elements`

Add the `karabiner.json` from this file to `~/.config/karabiner`, and you're good to go!
