# Programming

This file should contain a variety of setups that I use for programming.

## Git

All commits to Github should be signed. Azure Devops doesn't currently support GPG.

Follow [these instructions](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-gpg-key)
to create a new GPG key, and [these instructions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3174537/how-to-transfer-pgp-privatepublic-key-to-another-computer) to copy the key to a different machine.
It's probably best just to make new keys on a machine-by-machine basis so they can be revoked as necessary.

## Iterm2

Installed with:
```
brew cask install iterm2
```

I use a variant of the [Lovelace theme](https://iterm2colorschemes.com/).
My current theme can be imported from `/src/Iterm2Theme.json`.

## Pip

Pip can be installed with [get-pip.py](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/#installing-with-get-pip-py)
```
$ curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
$ python3 get-pip.py
$ rm get-pip.py
```

## Powerline

If anything here doesn't work, follow the reference linked below.

First install [Pip](#pip) (above). Then do as follows:

```
$ pip install --user powerline-status
$ pip install --user powerline-gitstatus
```

These lines should already be configured in your `~/.bash_profile`:

```
powerline-daemon -q
POWERLINE_BASH_CONTINUATION=1
POWERLINE_BASH_SELECT=1
. /Users/nathan/Library/Python/3.7/lib/python/site-packages/powerline/bindings/bash/powerline.sh
```

The final line can be gotten by running `pip show powerline-status` and then
using the `Location`  field, with everything past `site-packages`.

These should have been configured by `./install install.conf.bash.json`, but if not, run:
```
$ cp colorschemes.default.json ~/Library/Python/2.7/lib/python/site-packages/powerline/config_files/colorschemes/shell/default.json
$ cp themes.default.json ~/Library/Python/2.7/lib/python/site-packages/powerline/config_files/themes/shell/default.json
```

The necessary fonts may have already been installed, but if not, check [here](GettingStarted.md#fira-code).
Enable the fonts in the Terminal.app preferences.

You will need to restart your shell after installation.

## SSH

To configure Mac OS to
[remember the SSH key in the keychain](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/48502/how-can-i-permanently-add-my-ssh-private-key-to-keychain-so-it-is-automatically),
run this command:

```
$ ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/[your-private-key]
```

Your SSH config should already be properly configured, but if not
copy `PlatformAgnostic/ssh-config` to `~/.ssh/config`.

## tmux

I'm currently using `tmux` for `zsh` session management.
To get started, simply run:
```
$ brew install tmux
```

The config should already be linked to the one in this repo:
```
/dotfiles/.tmux.conf => /Users/nathan/.tmux.conf
```

### Handy Commands

Start a new session:
```
tmux new -s [session name]
```

Attach to an existing session:
```
tmux attach-session -t [session_name]
```

List existing sessions:
```
tmux ls
```

Detach from within a `tmux` session:
```
Ctrl+b, d // Denoted as C-b d
```

Show all `tmux` commands:
```
Ctrl+b, ? // Denoted as C-b ?
```

## VSCode

Install it with:
```
$ brew cask install visual-studio-code
```
